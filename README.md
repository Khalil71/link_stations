## Problem solving

Create a function that solves the most suitable (with most power) link station for a device at given point [x,y].

Using JavaScript in the browser or Node.js.

This problem can be solved in 2-dimensional space. Link stations have reach and power.

A link station’s power can be calculated:
`power = (reach - device's distance from link station)^2 if distance > reach, power = 0`

Function receives list of link stations and the point where the device is located.

Function should output following line:
_“Best link station for point x,y is x,y with power z”_
Or:
_“No link station within reach for point x,y”_

Link stations are located at points (x, y) and have reach (r) ([x, y, r]):

```
[
  [0, 0, 10],
  [20, 20, 5],
  [10, 0, 12]
]
```

Print out function output from points (x, y):
`(0,0), (100, 100), (15,10) and (18, 18)`.

## Solution

See connection.js, runnable with Node.js:
`node connection.js`
